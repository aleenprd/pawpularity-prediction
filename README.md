## Ideas 
Here are some ideas that I have in mind for taking this project further.

### Regression Problem with tabular data
- Use XG Boost
- Use Neural Net 

### Unsupervised Clustering with K Means, DB Scan
- Autoregressor popular data 
- T SNE 

### Image Processing
- GAN
- Transfer Learning 
- CNN Image Classification 
- Predict score from image itself 
- Is it a cat or a dog?
- What is the resolutin x by y of the photo
- Does the photo include text 
- Use the picture quality thingy neural net 
- If possible, is the pet young or adult?
- A lot of manual labelling going on 
- Is the per de rasa? pedigree?
- How many pets per photo?
- Pet color
- % of photo space (bound box) of pet 
- Coordinates of pet on photo
- Study top 50 most popular pics
- Bottom fifty least popular pics 

### How to label data into cats/dogs?
- Are dogs more popular or cats?
